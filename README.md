# Sign-language-recognition-using-CNN
To build a system which has the ability to predict and identify sign language using CNN technology which enables deaf or partially deaf people a better way to communicate.
-There is no denying that there is communication problem between the deaf and the hearing community. Very few can understand sign language. 
-Our aim is to build a model based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which successfully classify sign language symbols.
